Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business id), 39 (name)
v. Review = 10000 (id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select count(*)
from user
where (id is null OR name is null OR 
review_count is null OR 
yelping_since is null OR 
useful is null OR 
funny is null OR 
cool is null OR 
fans is null OR 
average_stars is null OR
compliment_hot is null OR
compliment_more is null OR
compliment_profile is null OR
compliment_cute is null OR
compliment_list is null OR
compliment_note is null OR
compliment_plain is null OR
compliment_cool is null OR
compliment_funny is null OR
compliment_writer is null OR
compliment_photos is null)
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: .0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max: 2000		avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT city, SUM(review_count) AS reviews
		FROM business
		GROUP BY city

As we can see in the above tables, we tend to see people with more reviews have more fans. We also see, however, that the longer you've been yelping for also correlates with number of fans.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Love: 1780, Hate: 232

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN text like '%love%' THEN 1 ELSE null end) as love,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN text like '%hate%' THEN 1 ELSE null end) as hate
from review
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT id, name, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+------------------------+-----------+------+
| id                     | name      | fans |

11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT name, fans, useful, funny, review_count, yelping_since

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	
I'm not positive what defines users being listed as "useful" or "funny", but all top 10 users in terms of most fans had useful and funny being greater than 0, so I'd wager that 100% of users have had at least some reviews that were useful or funny.

Lisa seems to be an outlier in terms of not many useful or funny results, but almost all our other most popular users in terms of fans have many funny or useful listings. That to me indicates there is a strong relationship between fans and being useful or funny.
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
Charlotte, Shopping - only have businesses with > 3 stars. Grouping by <4 and >=4 instead	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes, businesses with less than 4 stars are open less days per week, as well as for less hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, the businesses with less than 4 stars have more reviews than the businesses with >= 4 stars.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Using the neighborhood information, you could make an assumption that the University City area has better shopping spots than South End. That being said, we only have three different shops in Charlotte with reviews, so that would not be a smart assumption.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT *
FROM business B 
JOIN hours H ON B.id = H.business_id
JOIN category C ON C.business_id = B.id
WHERE (B.city = 'Charlotte' AND C.category LIKE 'Shopping')
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
Code:
SELECT is_open, avg(review_count),avg(stars)
FROM business B 
GROUP BY is_open

i. Difference 1:
         Businesses that are still open, on average, have more reviews than those that are closed. This makes sense because they'll most likely have had more time to collect reviews.
         
ii. Difference 2:
      Businesses that are still open, on average, have more stars than those that are closed. This too makes sense because of the more a restaurant is liked, the higher the likelihood they continue to stay open.  
       
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I want to do a sentiment analysis on the comments in a review to understand if that directly correlates with the star rating that's given.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I need my data set to have one row per tip, with some information about the business that they are commenting on, and some information about the user that is commenting. Is it more about the user who's commenting? Or can we see that comments directly correlate with star ratings? If it is about the user, that would allow us to get a better "true star rating" that accounts for the potentially overly negative/positive users that are commenting.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
Difficult to show with lots of columns, and long text entries, but here's an example row.

| ----X0BIDP9tA49U3RvdSQ |     4 | 2014-02-17 00:00:00 | Red, white and bleu salad was super yum and a great addition to the menu! This location was clean with great service and food served at just the right temps! Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos! When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again! |      0 |     0 |    0 | Ue6-WhXvI-_1xUIuapl0zQ...
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT *
FROM review r
LEFT JOIN business b on b.id = r.business_id
LEFT JOIN user u on u.id = r.user_id
